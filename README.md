# World Population Analysis 

## Objective

Analyze and visualize world population data to understand population distribution across income groups and countries. Create clear, professional visualizations suitable for data-driven decision making.

## Dataset

**Source:** World Bank - Population Indicators (API_SP.POP.TOTL)

**Contents:**
- Population data for 266 countries and regions (1960-2024)
- Country metadata including income group classifications
- Annual population figures in people

**Income Groups:**
- Low income
- Lower middle income
- Upper middle income
- High income

## Visualizations

### 1. Population by Income Group (2024)
**File:** `population_by_income_group_2024.png`
- Bar chart showing total population for each income group
- Values displayed in millions
- Color-coded for easy comparison

### 2. Population Distribution - Linear Scale
**File:** `population_distribution_linear.png`
- Histogram of population values across all countries
- Shows the raw distribution of country populations
- Useful for identifying outliers and clustering

### 3. Population Distribution - Log Scale
**File:** `population_distribution_log.png`
- Histogram using logarithmic (log₁₀) scale
- Reveals patterns across wide population ranges
- Better visibility of smaller countries

## Tools Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation and grouping
  - `matplotlib` - Visualization and plotting
  - `seaborn` - Enhanced styling
  - `numpy` - Numerical operations

## Installation

1. **Install Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python -m pip list
   ```

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd c:\PRODIGY_DS_01
   ```

2. **Run the visualization script:**
   ```bash
   python task1_visualization.py
   ```

3. **Output:**
   - Three PNG files will be generated in the project folder
   - Combined visualization will display on screen

## Key Insights

- Lower middle and upper middle income groups hold the largest shares of the global population in 2024.
- The linear histogram is heavily right-skewed: many countries have relatively small populations while a few have very large populations.
- The log-scale histogram reveals clearer structure across orders of magnitude, making patterns among small and mid-sized countries visible.

Short AI-style summary:

"I analyzed global population data for 2024. The middle-income groups (lower and upper) account for most people worldwide. When looking at raw counts, the distribution is skewed toward many low-population countries and a few very large ones. Transforming values using a log scale uncovers patterns that are otherwise hidden, especially among smaller nations."
